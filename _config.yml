  I am a PhD candidate at the [ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies](https://aimedtech.org.au/) at the University of Melbourne, where I am in the <mark>final six months</mark> of my doctoral studies. My thesis focuses on Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), supervised by [Prof Karin Verspoor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dUxHnbcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr Daniel Beck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NauI6dEAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr Michael Conway](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=uiJso6MAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also in close collaboration with the University of Edinburgh at the [AD-SOLES project](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/research/camarades/research-portfolio/current-projects) with [Dr Kaitlyn Hair](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f3fWQWMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof Malcolm Macleod](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=_cLoK0sAAAAJ&hl=en).
  
  My thesis aims to predict and validate previously unknown knowledge for Alzheimer’s Disease using LBD methodologies. The study is motivated by the exponential growth of AD research findings and the complexity of AD at both molecular and clinical levels, which present significant challenges in identifying, extracting, and synthesizing pathological processes and clinical symptoms. LBD methodologies aim to reduce information overload and provide valuable insights into disease diagnosis, treatments, and mechanisms.

  I am looking for <mark>full-time opportunities</mark> and open to relocation.

  Interested areas include but not limited to: <mark>Natural language processing</mark>, <mark>large language models</mark>, and <mark>NLP applications</mark>.

          We explore different information extraction tools for annotation of interventions to support automated systematic reviews of preclinical AD animal studies. We compare two PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) extraction tools and two prompting-based learning strategies based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Motivated by the high recall of a dictionary-based approach, we define a two-stage method, removing false positives obtained from regexes with a pre-trained LM. With ChatGPT-based filtering using three-shot prompting, our approach reduces almost two-thirds of False Positives compared to the dictionary approach alone, while outperforming knowledge-free instructional prompting.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
